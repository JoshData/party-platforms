party-platforms
===============

The Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green, Justice, and Socialist National Party Platforms for 2012, cleaned up into nice XML and annotated with issue area tags. Also includes past party platforms, including the entire history of Democratic national party platforms.

What apps can you build with this?

Annotations
-----------

The platforms are annotated with two tags:

	<goal>...</goal> is used around abstract policy goals.
	
	<proposal>...</proposal> is used around specific policy proposals.
	
Each annotation tag has an attribute called "issues", which is a space-separated list of issue-area tags from this list:

	taxes
	budget
	federalreserve
	transparency
	finance
	discrimination
	lowincome
	elderly
	infrastructure
	privacy
	trade
	jobs
	immigration
	labor
	gaymarriage
	voting
	faith
	campaignfinance
	internet
	guns
	property
	abortion
	health
	science
	energy
	agriculture
	environment
	socialsecurity
	usps
	tsa
	nativeamericans
	dc
	civilservice
	territories
	education
	crime
	defense
	foreignpolicy
	
Annotation is a very subjective sport. I (Josh) have done my best to annotate the most relevant aspects of each platform to the national debate, rather than wrapping every word with a tag.
