party-platforms
===============

The Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, Green, Justice, and Socialist National Party Platforms for 2012, cleaned up into nice XML and annotated with issue area tags. Also includes past party platforms, including the entire history of Democratic national party platforms.

What apps can you build with this?

Annotations
-----------

The platforms are annotated with two tags:

	<goal>...</goal> is used around abstract policy goals.
	
	<proposal>...</proposal> is used around specific policy proposals.
	
Each annotation tag has an attribute called "issues", which is a space-separated list of issue-area tags from this list:

	abortion				agriculture				budget
	campaignfinance	civilservice				crime
	dc							defense					discrimination
	education				elderly						energy
	environment			faith							federalreserve
	finance					foreignpolicy				gaymarriage
	guns						health						immigration
	infrastructure		internet					jobs
	labor						lowincome				nativeamericans
	privacy					property					science
	socialsecurity		taxes						territories
	trade					transparency			tsa
	usps						voting
	
Annotation is a very subjective sport. I (Josh) have done my best to annotate the most relevant aspects of each platform to the national debate, rather than wrapping every word with a tag.
